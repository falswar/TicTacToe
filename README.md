# Tic Tac Toe - MiniMax AI

A beautiful, interactive Tic Tac Toe game built with Python and Pygame, featuring an unbeatable AI opponent powered by the MiniMax algorithm.

## Features

- **Smart AI Opponent**: Uses the MiniMax algorithm for optimal gameplay
- **Two Difficulty Modes**: 
  - **Easy**: Random move selection for casual play
  - **Hard**: Unbeatable AI using MiniMax algorithm
- **Symbol Selection**: Choose to play as X or O
- **Beautiful Pink UI**: Eye-catching gradient pink theme with smooth animations
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of wins for both player and AI
- **Interactive Menu**: In-game menu for restarting, changing difficulty, or returning to start screen
- **Winning Animation**: Animated line drawing to highlight the winning combination

## Purpose

This project demonstrates the implementation of the **MiniMax algorithm** in game theory, showcasing how artificial intelligence can make optimal decisions in a zero-sum game. The game provides an educational example of:

- Game tree traversal
- Recursive algorithm implementation
- UI/UX design with Pygame
- State management in game development
